I specialise in information and cyber security, with strong skills in networking, infrastructure, cloud and automation.

I'm also CISSP certified.

You'll find me regularly doing [public speaking and contributing to information and cyber security debate](posts/public-stuff).

My current role is with Palo Alto Networks, where [I'm part of the Technoogy Innovation team within the Office of the CPO](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hollandj).

I'm proud of my many years in IT and information security since 2003, including roles in design, architect, build, support, consultancy, training and technical pre-sales.

Alongside security, I'm a keen follower of mobile technology, as a part-time blogger and podcast contributor.

I live in the West Midlands, UK.

You can also fnd me running, hiking, snowboarding, collating too many t-shirts, and playing guitar badly.
